$$
V=iR
$$

* Capacitor,

$$
i = C\frac{dV}{dt}
$$

* Inductor,

$$
V = L\frac{di}{dt}
$$

## Series and parallel connections

* Resistor

  * Series

    
    $$
    R = R_1+R_2+...+R_n
    $$

  * Parallel

    
    $$
    R=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}+...+ \frac{1}{R_n}}
    $$

* Inductors

  * Series

    
    $$

    $$
    L=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{L_1} + \frac{1}{L_2}+...+ \frac{1}{L_n}}
    $$

    $$
    C=C_1+C_2+...+C_n
    $$

## Connections and Sources

* Ground: reference for 0 volts
* Node: Voltage level the same everywhere on the node
* Voltage/Current source: independent or dependent

## Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL)

* The sum of voltages around any closed loop is zero
* If you encounter a plus signal you should add, otherwise subtract

## Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL)

* The sum of current entering a node is equal to the sum of current leaving

## Impedance

* Resistor voltage and current behavior

  
  $$
  Z_r=R
  $$
  

  ![Resistor impedance behavior](assets/images/resistor-impedance-behavior.jpg)

  * They are in phase

  * Therefore, frequency invariant

    Remember

    
    $$
    f(Hz)=\frac{1}{T}
    $$

    $$
    \omega(rad/s)=2\pi f=\frac{2\pi}{T}
    $$

* Capacitor voltage and current behavior

  
  $$
  Z_C=\frac{1}{j\omega C}
  $$
  ![Capacitor impedance behavior](assets/images/capacitor-impedance-behavior.jpg)

  * Current leads voltage (comes before)

* Inductor voltage and current behavior

  
  $$
  Z_L=j\omega L
  $$
  ![Inductor impedance behavior](assets/images/inductor-impedance-behavior.jpg)

  * ​	Current lags voltage (comes after)

### Impedance in series

$$
Z_eq=Z_1+Z_2+...+Z_n
$$

### Impedance in parallel

$$
Z_{eq}=[\frac{1}{Z_1}+\frac{1}{Z_1}+...+\frac{1}{Z_n}]^{-1}
$$

## Transfer functions

* Two-port network case

  
  $$
  V_i(t)=A_{in}cos(\omega t+\theta_{in})
  $$

  $$
  V_o(t)=A_{out}cos(\omega t+\theta_{out})
  $$

* In this case the input is sinusoidal and in the steady state the output is also sinusoidal

* Also, has the same frequency but different amplitude and phase

  
  $$
  V_i=A_{in}\angle{\theta_{in}}
  $$

  $$
  V_o=A_{out}\angle\theta{out}
  $$

* Transfer function is a relationship between output and input

  
  $$
  H(\omega)V_i=V_o
  $$

  $$
  H(\omega)A_{in}\angle\theta{in}=A_{out}\angle\theta{out}
  $$

* If we take the magnitude for both sides

  
  $$
  A_{out}=|{H(\omega)}|A_{in}
  $$

  $$
  \theta_{out}=\angle H(\omega) + \theta_{in}
  $$

## Summary of simple circuits transfer functions

* Resistor, capacitor circuit

$$
H(\omega)=\frac{1}{1+RC\omega j}
$$

* Capacitor, resistor circuit

$$
H(\omega)=\frac{RC\omega j}{1+RC\omega j}
$$

* Resistor, inductor, capacitor circuit

$$
H(\omega)=\frac{1}{1-\omega^2 LC + RC\omega j}
$$

## Frequency response plots

* Frequency response is the magnitude vs omega, for instance, a RC circuit has magnitude of

$$
|H(\omega)|=\frac{1}{1+(RC\omega)^2}
$$

* That's it, the magnitude is given by

  
  $$
  |H(\omega)|=|\frac{1}{a + bj}|=\frac{1}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}
  $$

* In the bode diagram, the magnitude has units of decibels (dB), and has the following relationship

  
  $$
  H(dB)=20log(|H(\omega)|)
  $$

* also, omega is in the log scale

* The angle vs omega is given by

  
  $$
  \angle \frac{1}{a+bj} =-atan(\frac{b}{a})=-tan(RC\omega)
  $$

* The transfer function shows how a circuit processes signals of different frequencies

## Circuit response study case

Given the following input voltage


$$
V_i=cos(50t)+cos(800t)
$$


find R and C for the following circuit, such as


$$
V_o=0.95cos(50t -20^\circ) + 0.13cos(80t -85^\circ)
$$

<img src="assets/images/rc-circuit.jpg" alt="RC circuit with sinusoidal input" style="zoom:50%;" />

Using matlab and simulink parameter estimator, we find R =  228.5176 and C = 3.4629e-05.

The given bode diagram in linear scale is founded to be almost the needed values, numerical computations requires more analysis to reach the needed values of magnitude 0.95 at 50 rad/s and 0.13 at 800 rad/s and phase angle -20° at 50 rad/s and -85° at 800 rad/s.

## BODE diagram

A bode diagram is actually given in log scales units, as showing as follow, where


$$
|H(\omega)|(dB)=20log_{10}(|H(\omega)|)
$$

### Bode Plot First-Order characteristics

<img src="assets/images/bode-diagram-from-estimated-transfer-function-values-in-log-clean.jpg" />

[***Corner frequency***](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/corner-frequency), w0, often called the −3 dB point. At this frequency the value of system gain or sensitivity is only 0.707 of its value at DC (zero frequency).

In the RC circuit, the corner frequency is given by


$$
\omega_0=\frac{1}{RC}
$$
***Attenuation rate***. Beyond the corner frequency the sensitivity of a first-order system rolls off at the rate of −20 dB per decade of frequency. Another way to look at it is that the response drops a factor of 10 for every 10× increase in frequency. 

***Phase shift***. At the corner frequency, the system will delay a [sinusoidal input](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/sinusoidal-input) signal by 45°. As one increases the signal frequency, this phase delay increases asymptotically to 90°.

While measurements such as the corner frequency describe a system's response to sinusoidal stimuli, they also provide some insight into how a device behaves in response to other stimuli. One common example is the system's response to an input in the form of an abrupt step, usually called the *step response.* The time that a first-order system needs to settle to within 37% of its final value (called the system *time constant,* represented by τ) is given by 1/(2πw0).

### Bode Plot Second-Order characteristics

#### Overdamped

In this case,


$$
\omega_0=\frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}
$$
and at high frequency, the attenuation rate is equal to -40 dB per decade of frequency.

<img src="assets/images/transfer-function-magnitude-phase-second-order-example.jpg" />

#### Underdamped

In this case,


$$
\omega_0=\frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}
$$
but as R gets decreased we've got a resonant peak at a resonant frequency, at that frequency the output amplitude is greater than the input amplitude in resonant region. And as R gets smaller, the change in phase becomes even sharper in terms of phase transition.

### Summary

* A frequency response is a plot of the transfer function versus frequency, in particularly we are looking for the magnitude and the angle

* The frequency response can be used to determine the steady-state sinusoidal response of a circuit at different frequencies

  The whole point of the transfer function and its frequency response is to understand how the circuit processes signals of different frequencies. Does it attenuate frequencies in certain ranges? Or does it amplify signals? Or make them larger? Like that last case with the resonant peak we had the output greater than the input. If we take a look at the transfer function and plot it versus frequency, we can understand what's going on. Is it amplifying or is it attenuating? And if so, in what frequency range?
