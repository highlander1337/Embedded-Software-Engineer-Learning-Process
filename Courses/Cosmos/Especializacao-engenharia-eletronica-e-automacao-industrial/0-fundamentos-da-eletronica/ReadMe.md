## Diodes and transistors

### Diode specifications

* Direct polarization

  * In this case, the direct polarization voltage must be equal or greater than the potential barrier

    

$$
V_D \ge V_\gamma
$$

* The relationship between current and power dissipated is equal to

  
  $$
  P_{MD}=V_{D}I_{DM}
  $$

The following graph shows the relationship between the voltage and current limits in a diode.

As observed, as the voltage increase so does the current, but exponentially, until reach it's maximum value supported by material properties. In the presence of reverse polarization, the diode still conduct current until reach the minimum value, if the voltage decrease below the rupture voltage, the diode works as an open circuit.
